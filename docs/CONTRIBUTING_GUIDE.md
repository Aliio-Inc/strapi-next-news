## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

Adhere to the following format for commit messages:

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Example:**

```
feat: add user authentication with JWT

Implemented JWT-based authentication to secure API endpoints. Users can now register and log in to access protected routes.
```

### JavaScript Style Guide

- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- **Quotes**: Use single quotes `'` for strings.
- **Semicolons**: Omit semicolons; rely on ASI (Automatic Semicolon Insertion).
- **Arrow Functions**: Use arrow functions for anonymous functions.
- **Destructuring**: Prefer destructuring assignment where applicable.
- **Modules**: Use ES6 modules (`import`/`export`) instead of CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`).

## Branching Model

We follow the **GitFlow** branching model:

- **`main` Branch**: Contains the stable production-ready code.
- **`develop` Branch**: Integrates features and fixes before merging into `main`.
- **Feature Branches**: Named as `feature/feature-name` for new features.
- **Bugfix Branches**: Named as `bugfix/bug-name` for bug fixes.
- **Release Branches**: Named as `release/version-number` for preparing releases.
- **Hotfix Branches**: Named as `hotfix/issue-number` for urgent fixes on `main`.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To set up the project locally for development:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aliio-Inc/strapi-next-news.git
   cd strapi-next-news
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Follow the [Installation Guide](./Installation.md) to set up `.env` files.
4. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

## Running Tests

Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR:

1. **Navigate to Backend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   # or
   yarn test
   ```

## Additional Notes
