## Introduction

**Next News** is built using a modern tech stack that separates concerns between the frontend and backend, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and a seamless user experience. This architecture leverages the strengths of Next.js for frontend rendering and Strapi for robust content management.

## High-Level Architecture

![High-Level Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/Aliio-Inc/strapi-next-news/blob/main/assets/architecture-diagram.png?raw=true)

1. **Frontend**:

   - Built with Next.js 14.
   - Utilizes Shadcn for UI components.
   - Handles user interactions, routing, and rendering of content.

2. **Backend**:

   - Powered by Strapi, a headless CMS.
   - Manages content creation, storage, and API provisioning.
   - Handles authentication and authorization.

3. **Database**:

   - PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data storage.
   - Stores content, user data, and other persistent information.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Frontend deployed on platforms like Vercel.
   - Backend deployed on platforms like Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS.
   - CI/CD pipelines automate testing and deployment processes.

## Frontend Architecture

### Next.js 14

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enhances SEO and initial load performance by rendering pages on the server.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time for optimal performance.
- **API Routes**: Allows creation of serverless functions within the Next.js application for handling specific backend tasks.

### Shadcn UI Components

- **Component Library**: Provides a set of pre-designed, accessible, and customizable UI components.
- **Theming**: Supports easy theming and styling to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.

### State Management

- **React Context API**: Manages global state such as user authentication status and theme settings.
- **Optional Integration**: Can integrate with state management libraries like Redux or Zustand for more complex state needs.

### Routing and Navigation

- **File-Based Routing**: Utilizes Next.js's file-based routing system for easy navigation setup.
- **Dynamic Routes**: Handles dynamic content like individual articles and categories through dynamic routing.

## Backend Architecture

### Strapi Headless CMS

- **Content Management**: Allows non-developers to create and manage content types, such as Articles, Categories, and Authors.
- **API Generation**: Automatically generates RESTful and GraphQL APIs based on defined content types.
- **Extensibility**: Supports plugins and customizations to extend functionality as needed.

### Database Integration

- **ORM/ODM**: Uses built-in ORM (e.g., Bookshelf for SQL databases or Mongoose for MongoDB) to interact with the database.
- **Data Modeling**: Defines relationships between different content types to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.

### API Structure

- **RESTful APIs**: Provides endpoints for CRUD operations on content types.
- **GraphQL Support**: Optional integration for more flexible querying capabilities.
- **Authentication**: Handles user authentication through JWT tokens, managing access to protected endpoints.

### Authentication and Authorization

- **User Roles**: Defines roles such as Admin, Editor, and Author with specific permissions.
- **Protected Routes**: Secures API endpoints and frontend pages based on user roles and authentication status.

## Database Architecture

### Database Choice

- **PostgreSQL**: Preferred for relational data, complex queries, and data integrity.
- **MongoDB**: Suitable for flexible, schema-less data storage and rapid development cycles.

### Schema Design

- **Articles**: Title, content, author, category, published date, featured image, tags.
- **Categories**: Name, description, parent category (for nested categories).
- **Authors**: Name, bio, profile picture, contact information.

### ORM/ODM Usage

- **Bookshelf.js (PostgreSQL)**: For managing relational data with defined models and relationships.
- **Mongoose (MongoDB)**: For schema-less data models with flexible document structures.

## Deployment Architecture

### Frontend Deployment

- **Platform**: Vercel is recommended for seamless integration with Next.js, offering features like automatic deployments and CDN support.
- **Static Assets**: Served via CDN for fast load times and reduced server load.
- **Environment Variables**: Managed through Vercel's dashboard to securely handle API URLs and other configurations.

### Backend Deployment

- **Platforms**: Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS, or any platform supporting Node.js applications.
- **Scaling**: Configured to handle increased traffic with horizontal or vertical scaling as needed.
- **Environment Variables**: Securely managed through the hosting platform's environment settings.

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing, building, and deployment processes.
- **Automated Testing**: Runs tests on each pull request to ensure code quality and functionality.
- **Deployment Triggers**: Automatically deploys to staging or production environments upon successful builds.

## Scalability and Performance

### Caching Strategies

- **HTTP Caching**: Implements caching headers to reduce redundant requests and improve load times.
- **Server-Side Caching**: Uses in-memory caches like Redis for frequently accessed data.
- **CDN Caching**: Distributes static assets globally to minimize latency.

### Load Balancing

- **Traffic Distribution**: Utilizes load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple server instances.
- **High Availability**: Ensures the application remains available even during peak traffic or server failures.

### Static Site Generation

- **Pre-rendering Pages**: Generates static HTML for pages that do not require frequent updates, enhancing performance.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Updates static pages in the background as new data becomes available without rebuilding the entire site.

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: Ensures sensitive data is encrypted both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.
- **Access Controls**: Restricts access to sensitive endpoints and data based on user roles.

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make within a specific timeframe.
- **Input Validation**: Sanitizes and validates all incoming data to prevent injection attacks.
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricts API access to trusted frontend origins.

### Environment Management

- **Environment Variables**: Keeps sensitive information like API keys and database credentials out of the codebase.
- **Secrets Management**: Utilizes secure methods for storing and accessing secrets in production environments.

## Monitoring and Logging

### Monitoring Tools

- **New Relic / Datadog**: Tracks application performance, uptime, and resource usage.
- **Google Analytics**: Monitors user interactions and engagement on the frontend.

### Logging Practices

- **Structured Logging**: Logs are formatted consistently to facilitate easy searching and analysis.
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregates logs from frontend and backend into a centralized system for streamlined monitoring.
- **Error Tracking**: Uses tools like Sentry to capture and alert on application errors and exceptions.
